tree shaking:
Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript build processes, especially with bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, 
to eliminate dead code from the final bundle. Dead code refers to any code that is not being used or referenced anywhere in the application. 
Tree shaking helps reduce the size of the JavaScript bundle, resulting in faster load times for web applications.

Lazy loading :
is a technique used in web development to improve performance by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed. This is particularly useful for large web applications with many components or assets, 
as it helps reduce the initial page load time and only loads resources when they are required.
