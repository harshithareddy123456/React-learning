react is a javascript library used to build dynamic web applications and single page applications without reloading the entire page

key components and work flow:
1.components:
components are building blocks of React which are reusable all accross the aaplication
component can be function or class

2.jsx:
jsx will allow us to write html like syntax in javascript
JSX is transformed into JavaScript objects by tools like Babel.

3.virtual DOM:
inmemory representation of an actual DOM
When the state of a component changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one (a process called "reconciliation"). Only the differences are updated in the real DOM, making updates efficient and fast.

4.States and props:
state: state is an object that holds dynamic data of the component.when the state changes it results in re-render of the component
props: props are input to the component.they are read only and will be passed down from parent to child

5.Lifecycle Methods:

Class Components: Class components can use lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount) to perform actions at different stages of the component's lifecycle.
Hooks: Function components can use hooks like useEffect to handle side effects and mimic lifecycle methods.
