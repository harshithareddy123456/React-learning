create react app is a abstraction of all the react application
we want to know the configurations of our application

webpack is a bundler which will convert our different files into css,html,js which are browser understandable 

we have multiple concepts here:
loaders
plugins
sourcemap - which will allow us to check the issues in source code
please check in github for better understanding

babel loader- is used for cross browser compatibility

Interviewer: Can you explain to me what webpack is and how it works?
Priya: Think of webpack as a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes all your modules, such as JavaScript files, CSS files, and images, and bundles them together into a single output file. It also has the ability to optimize and transform your code, making it more efficient for browsers to parse and execute. 𝐈𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮'𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐩.

Interviewer: Let's talk about loaders and plugins in webpack. Can you explain what they are and how they differ?
Priya: Loaders and plugins are both essential parts of webpack, but they serve different purposes. Loaders are used to preprocess files before they are added to the bundle. For example, you might use a loader like Babel to transpile your ES6 JavaScript code into ES5, which is compatible with older browsers. Plugins, on the other hand, are used to perform a wider range of tasks, such as bundle optimization, asset management, and environment configuration. They hook into the webpack compilation process and can manipulate the bundle in various ways. 𝐀𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐜𝐚𝐤𝐞.

Interviewer: What is tree shaking, and how does webpack utilize it to optimize bundles?
Priya: Tree shaking is a process used to remove unused code from your bundle. It works by analyzing the code and identifying which modules and exports are not being used anywhere in your application. Then, it eliminates those unused parts from the final bundle, resulting in a smaller and more efficient package.

Module Federation is an advanced feature introduced in Webpack 5 that enables multiple separate builds to work together in a single application. It allows for the sharing and loading of code between different Webpack builds at runtime, facilitating a microfrontend architecture. This is particularly useful for large-scale applications developed by multiple teams where independent deployments and decoupled development are critical.
