// In React, both state and props are used to manage data and pass information between components, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

// State:
// State is an internal data storage mechanism used to store and manage component-specific data.
// State is owned and managed by the component itself, meaning that only the component that owns the state can modify it.
// State is mutable and can be updated using the setState() method provided by React.
// Changes to state trigger re-rendering of the component, causing React to update the component's UI to reflect the new state.
// State is initialized within the component's constructor or using the useState() hook in functional components.
// Props:
// Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
// Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the component receiving them. They are immutable.
// Props are passed down from parent components and are accessible as properties of the component's props object.
// Changes to props do not trigger re-rendering of the component. Instead, the component will re-render if its own state or the props it receives change.
// Props are defined by the parent component when rendering the child component and are passed as attributes.
// In summary, the main differences between state and props in React are:

// State is internal to a component and is mutable, while props are passed down from parent components and are immutable.
// State is used for managing component-specific data and triggering re-renders, while props are used for passing data between components.
